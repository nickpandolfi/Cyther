MAINTAIN

    Keep __all__ up to date with all the useful functions

    Comment and properly docstring everything

    Make sure that the version specified makes sense (major.minor.patch)

    Make sure that all the message passoffs make sense. Update 'ERROR_PASSOFF' value?

    Keep the -h follow all the other common -h practices

    Make sure that the -h is up to date, including all the version info of all the external features (gcc/Cython)

    Make sure that you constantly search for the assumptions cyther makes. Make no mistake

EASY FIX

    Put the line: platform.platform().strip().lower().startswith('windows') in the script checker

    Change the name of should_compile to isOutdated, it makes more sense.

    Format all the system constant strings

    How to deal with non-standard extensions that people might be using? Don't error, but just have it print that
    it is non standard, and work anyway?

MEDIUM FIX

HARD FIX

    When the -w (watch) option is used, and the contents of the source file are being imported, the file will not be
    able to recompile

    Get the operating system dependant flags that are passed to gcc by distutils and inject them when building the
    preset

EASY NEW FEATURES

    Function to clean a directory of everything cyther related, has an option to remove the .pyd or .so files

    Function to clean a directory of everything 'locally build' related, or move it to a cythercache

    Add more presets, including one that compiles really fast, for testing purposes

    Extend the -l option to take a specific directory to build the files in

    Specify how to give pass off args and 3rd party modules to include in the epilog section of '-h'
    Do this also with the cython and gcc pass-off arguments

HARD NEW FEATURES

    Have an option to run the code under `if __name__ == '__main__'` statement directly in the terminal

    Always back up the previous compile if there was one. Then if there is an error, don't overwrite it with anything,
    but instead, keep the backup version. Have the new compilation attempt be built in the __cythercache__ directory

    An option to just build the C, or to just take the C and build only the extension

    Get -w (watch), to exit safely and keep the same command prompt open. Is this possible?

    Make sure that the file order provided doesn't matter when compiling multiple files that may depend on one another

    Don't have args and file, have only one object with everything in it

    Recompile the libpythonXY.a static library if it does not exist:

        Possible tool to help: dlltool, reimp, pexports, gendef

            It would be best to use a tool that always exists on each and every platform

        Possible usage: reimp.exe -d %lib_file%\ndlltool.exe -d %def_file% -D %dll_file% -k -l %a_file%

        Take a look at your favorites page for instructions on pexport

QUESTIONS:

    What about bcpp or cygwin or cl??

    Should we even give the option to build locally in the same file?

    Use a 'subparser' to process the commands to cython and gcc??

    Do the commands to argparse need to be changed. Maybe give them better names, and give each a long name.

    Is it necessary to make sure that os.pardir will never be a problem??

    How about using tempfile for the building files??

On Hold:

    Where is the best spot to put the README and all the other files?

    Explicitly state that neither Cython nor any GNU product nor Python is yours, and all rights belong to their
    respective owners

    Should we make CytherError traceback invisible?

    If is windows, just call subprocess with where
    If is unix, just call subprocess with which
    If unable to do this, THEN try to import and use which
    If this doesnot exist, raise error?
