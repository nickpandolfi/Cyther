    Properly encapsulated the 'cytherize' and 'core' functions
    Added the -X and -T options, meant for super powerful debugging and building

    Split cyther.py into multiple modules to make everything easier to understand
    Updated setup.cfg to include the correct README
    Implemented entry_points on setup tools to make an executable script
